/**
  * Provides brace-matching support in WDL by enumerating the types of braces that can be logically
  * considered as opening and closing each other.
  *
  * How to implement this is not especially well documented but this is based on this question:
  * https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115000055450-How-to-make-my-plugin-to-highlight-a-matching-parenthesis-in-the-editor-of-a-language
  *
  * And this one:
  * https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115000393430-Auto-closing-braces-in-a-custom-language-BraceMatcher-not-working
  *
  * And on the PairedBraceMatcher javadoc comments:
  * https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/master/platform/lang-api/src/com/intellij/lang/PairedBraceMatcher.java
  *
  * And on the BracePair javadoc comments:
  * https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/master/platform/lang-api/src/com/intellij/lang/BracePair.java
  *
  * It's pretty logical: we list the pairs of tokens that can open and close each other, and intellij will auto-insert the
  * closer when we type the opener, and highlight them together (having worked out any nesting too).
